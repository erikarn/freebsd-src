rtw88 stuff that may be worth porting over

* look at __priority_queue_cfg() - eg REG_RXFF_BNDY,
* rsvd_boundary, rsvd_drv_addr, page offset, everything
  around that mess.
* any/all of the calib stuff? if it's not done ni firmware?
* the stuff to decode the old/new firmware headers and print out
  the versions during load time?


known issues;

* the occasional truncated packet, missing 4 bytes from the end
  of the buffer (which is typically half of the CCMP IV.)  Since the
  hardware tags the frame as decrypted and IP/TCP/UDP checksum validated,
  the malformed packet is sent up and confuses things / hangs TCP, hard.

  The workaround for now is to disable PHYSTS - clearing the
  R92C_RCR_APP_PHYSTS bit in the receive config register.
  However, that means all of the RX phy status - RX rate, RSSI, etc -
  is no longer available.

  It only shows up when VHT is enabled and receiving VHT frames.
  It's not a problem with HT or legacy rates.

* The Short-GI, LDPC, STBC, etc decision bits need to be pushed into
  net80211, and take into account the selected rate and local/peer
  capabilities.  This is going to be especially true for AP modes.

TODO:

* no way to get VHT rates from AMRR yet, hence hacks
* I'm not yet loading in 2SS rates for 2 stream NICs, need to do that
